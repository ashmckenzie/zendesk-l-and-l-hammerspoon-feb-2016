## Watchers

Create callback functions for events such as:

  * A screen, USB device has been plugged in
  * The connected WIFI SSID has changed
  * An application has started up, minimised / hidden or activated
  * A file / directory on disk has been updated

---

## Window management

* Ensure applications are always in the same place
  * Manually using hotkeys
  * Automatically using 'layouts'
* Move and resize application windows using hotkeys

---

## Hotkeys

* Great for moving an resizing application windows
* Start a particular application / applications
* Bring a particular application to focus
  * <SUPER> + F focuses Flowdock for me
* Force a 'layout' refresh

---

## Written in Lua

* Available APIs are many!
* Infinite possibilities for customisation!
* Hammerspoon user contributed library eco-system?
